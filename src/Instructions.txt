// Import the state hook
// Import the Posts (plural!) and SearchBar components, since they are used inside App component
// Import the dummyData


STATES
  // Create a state called `posts` to hold the array of post objects, **initializing to dummyData**.
  // This state is the source of truth for the data inside the app. You won't be needing dummyData anymore.
  // To make the search bar work (which is stretch) we'd need another state to hold the search term.
